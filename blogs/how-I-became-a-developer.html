                <div class="blog-content">
                    <h5 class="subtitle">Background</h5>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in a home where creativity and artistic ability were common place. My grandfather on my dad's side was an incredible painter. Our house is decorated with paintings sent from Russia to my parents. As my siblings would finish up school and move
                        away, a painting would go with them.
                        <br>
                        <br> All that to say, art has always surrounded me.
                        <br>
                        <br> In High School I found art and math to be my strongest subjects which pushed me to pursue a career that would incorporate both problem solving and creativity.
                        <br>
                        <br> Through an independant study I began to explore
                        <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview?term=1-YEAR&support=null" target="_blank"><u>Revit</u></a> and architecture in general. Everything about the field was appealing - especially the artistic components. In
                        2016 I had the opportunity to job shadow at an Architecture Firm is Lewisburg, PA. 30 minutes into the job shadow I knew this was not what I wanted.
                        <br>
                        <br> I imagined large white papers on tables, rules, compasses and architects surrounding the table as they deigned... not a bunch of architects on computers working silently.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="subtitle">College</h5>
                    <p>
                        Coming to College I decided that if I couldn't find a major with art and math then I would just become a High School teacher for those subjects. 4 days into that and I hadn't painted or solved an equation.
                        <br>
                        <br> Lost, I scrolled the Shippenburgs list of majors and landed on Mechanical Engineering. It was the second week of my freshman year when I was sitting in my first programming class listening to a professor talk about things
                        that sounded like a different language.
                        <br>
                        <br> I understood the word <i>"keyboard."</i>
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="subtitle">Hello World!</h5>
                    <p>
                        Assignment 1 was writing a "Hello World" program. I will never forget that when I ran the program the terminal said:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint code">> Hello Wolrd!</pre>

                    <p>
                        It blew my mind.
                        <br>
                        <br> I realized for the first time in my life that the computer was only as smart as I was. If I couldn't spell, the computer couldn't either. Right there, in MCT 052 I decided this was this <em>THING</em> that would be my perfect
                        balance of creativity and problem solving.
                        <br>
                        <br> I fell in love, got the A and made my final major change to Software Engineering.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="subtitle">Reflecting</h5>
                    <p>
                        It is so strange now to look back and recall that first semester. Ups and downs and some tears. But that "Hello World" epiphany has stuck with me.
                        <br>
                        <br> The computer is only as smart as me.
                        <br>
                        <br> I make it a point to talk to underclassmen now who are sitting behind a code editor. Relating to them is so easy because I remember what it was like. I remember trying to comprehend for-loops, if-else statements, pointers
                        and my share of
                    </p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint code">> Segmentation fault (core dumped)</pre>

                    <p>
                        <br> Now I laugh thinking back to that Architecture job shadow, seeing all of those people working silently at their computers and thinking <i>"I do not want to spend the rest of my life sitting behind a computer."</i>
                        <br>
                        <br> Now I wouldn't want it any other way.
                    </p>
